# MachineLearningR
Projects created while practicing MachineLearning with R by Brett Lantz.
1. Iris_DecisionTree.R implements decision tree to classify "Iris" species.
2. ConcreteStrengthPrediction.R implements neural network to predict the strength of concrete. Distribution.pdf gives the data distribution of different columns, "ModelStructure" pdfs give the model stucture for hidden neuron 1 and 5.
